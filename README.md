# FOF3 Basic
A hello world type example for Akeeba FOF3  as a walkthrough for building a Joomla! component from the ground up.

**Note:** This step in the tutorial assumes you have FOF3 installed. If not, you can get an FOF3 install package from http://Akeebabackup.com

**Note2:** This step in the tutorial also assumes you have set up your component on a development site (local recommended). That means your Joomla development site needs your component installed with the database tables. You could also set up your tables, copy the files to the site, and add a record to the #__extensions table so you could browse directly to the component via [yoursite url or local url]/administrator/index.php?option=com_[your component's name i.e. fof3basic]... (but an install is easier since you have a menu item to work with)

## Step 4 - Browse your views and remove the scaffolding
In step 3 we set up everything to use FOF3's Quick prototyping Scaffolding features to build the frontend views, and site language files for us. All that we need to do is browse to our component `sitehost_joomla/index.php?option=com_[your component name i.e. fof3basic]` and look at each of the list views and item views. It's helpful at this point to have a few records saved in your administration interface to help with the browsing of the frontend views. We also need to be sure to browse the frontend views while logged in and logged out of the frontend to ensure all the necessary files for frontend edit views are created. If you don't want edit views for the front end just skip browsing while logged in. That's it, we have the prototype for our frontend user interface via the Scaffolding feature. All we need to do now is copy the newly created files to our source control and turn off the Scaffolding development tool.
